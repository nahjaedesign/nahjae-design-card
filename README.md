##Documentation For My Digital Business Card
My first experience coding my own website. I created my own personal branding while learning about HTML, CSS, and accessibility design. It was very important to me that I was able to accomplish this TV static effect and, through a lot of trial and error, I was able to achieve this bold and graphic site. Before diving into coding I created several mockups in Adobe Illustrator for both desktop and mobile formats.
